# UI Design

## Wireframe

For our web application, we have 5 total wireframe designs in mind to create: The login page, home page, playlist page, swiping page, and texting page. 

Login Page: 
![Login Page](326login.png)

The first wireframe design created represents the login page for a user. Upon accessing our web app, they see a logo of our product and  are given the instruction to login using their associated email address and password. Users are also given the option to have the web app  remember their login details so that they do not need to enter them again in the future. Once they fill out the information, they can click the "sign in" button to lead them to the next part of the application.

Qui commodi beatae. Quaerat saepe tempora nisi labore ducimus corporis adipisci repellat nihil. Dolores est sed ratione consequatur est magnam cupiditate. Repellendus molestias qui doloribus. Deserunt quidem temporibus. Sunt hic laudantium vitae natus est.

![Analysis page](Analysis.png)
This design depicts what the analysis page looks like for a user. They are able to choose whether they like a song or not and thus can help us analyze their taste in music and help suggest similar songs

![playlist page](playlist.png)
This page just allows users to add songs to a playlist and finally export that playlist to spotify

### Story 1

Story Protagonist: Bob, 21 years old. A college student who goes to school at a college town a few hours from the nearest city.

MusicMatch and Bob: As someone who lives in a college town relatively far from the nearest city, Bob has trouble meeting people who are into the same things he's into (basically, cool!). He sees an ad for MusicMatch while scrolling through instagram and decides to check it out. Upon opening the site, he is met with a homepage that looks like this:

*INSERT HOME PAGE SCREENSHOT*

Since Bob is more interested in the "meeting people" part of MusicMatch, he clicks on MusicMatch Connect which then prompts him to add 10 - 15 of his favorite songs. Once he's done that, Bob waits while a loading screen pops up loading a list of people and their favorite songs! Bob then sends five chat requests, the most he can send per day on the free version, to five different individuals whose favorite songs he recognized. 

*INSERT POTENTIAL MATCHES UI*

About 30 minutes later, Bob hears a ping signifying someone has accepted his chat request, prompting him to open up a chat window and start talking to his lucky match!

### Story 2

Story Protagonist: Shreya, 15 years old. A bored highschool kid looking to find songs similar to her favorite song: "Fireflies by Owl City". 

MusicMatch and Shreya: Having spent the last two hours looking through Youtube's suggested songs similar to Fireflies and finding nothing, Shreya has given up hope of finding similar music. She texts her friend her frustrations only to be told "OMG YOU GOTTA CHECK MUSICMATCH OUT !!!!!"

Having logged onto her laptop, Shreya heads over to MusicMatch's website to check it out. Upon seeing two options for "MusicMatch Connect" and "MusicMatch Discover" on the home page, she clicks on MusicMatch Discover. After being prompted to enter in one song's name, she waits for the loading screen to finish...loading. 

A couple seconds later, a list of ten songs show up on her screen with an analytical breakdown of each song provided under it (showing how they were similar to her chosen song). She clicks on the first song and is redirected to the youtube link for the song where thirty seconds in, she promptly declares it her new favorite song.
